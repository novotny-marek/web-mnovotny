# Streetscape morphometrics: Expanding momepy to analyze urban form from the street point of view

**Date:** July 23, 2025

**Language:** English

## Abstract

In this paper, we present momepy.streetscape, a new module of the Python 
library widely used for morphometric analysis, specifically designed to study
streetscapes from a pedestrian perspective. The module enables systematic,
in-depth analysis of street-based morphology using vector datasets of the built
environment. It quantifies features such as street width, façade continuity,
and other compositional attributes that shape pedestrian experience and
perception. By incorporating streetscape metrics, the expanded momepy functions
support interdisciplinary research into how street-level configurations
influence social interactions, walkability, and neighborhood vitality.
