# Streetscape morphometrics: Expanding momepy to analyze urban form from the street point of view

**Date:** July 23, 2025

**Language:** English

## Abstract

In this paper, we present momepy.streetscape, a new module of the Python 
library widely used for morphometric analysis, specifically designed to study
streetscapes from a pedestrian perspective. The module enables systematic,
in-depth analysis of street-based morphology using vector datasets of the built
environment. It quantifies features such as street width, fa√ßade continuity,
and other compositional attributes that shape pedestrian experience and
perception. By incorporating streetscape metrics, the expanded momepy functions
support interdisciplinary research into how street-level configurations
influence social interactions, walkability, and neighborhood vitality.
